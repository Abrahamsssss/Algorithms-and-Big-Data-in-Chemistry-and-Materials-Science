# Algorithms-and-Big-Data-in-Chemistry-and-Materials-Science


## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **compressive strength of concrete** based on various input features such as cement content, water content, and other materials used in concrete mixtures. The dataset is sourced from a study on concrete properties and contains relevant features necessary for accurate prediction.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the compressive strength of concrete, helping to optimize the composition of concrete mixtures for various construction applications.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- **Cement (kg)**: Amount of cement in the mixture.
- **Slag (kg)**: Amount of blast furnace slag.
- **Fly ash (kg)**: Amount of fly ash.
- **Water (kg)**: Amount of water.
- **Superplasticizer (kg)**: Amount of superplasticizer added.
- **Coarse Aggregate (kg)**: Amount of coarse aggregate (gravel or crushed stone).
- **Fine Aggregate (kg)**: Amount of fine aggregate (sand).
- **Age (days)**: Age of the concrete at the time of testing.
- **Compressive Strength (MPa)**: Compressive strength of the concrete.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handle missing values (if any) and outliers.
    - Normalize/scale the data for better performance.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Explore relationships between features.
    - Experiment with feature selection techniques.
3. **Model Selection**:
    - Try different regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
    - Compare their performance using cross-validation and evaluation metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the best model on the test set.
    - Analyze feature importance.
5. **Results**:
    - Report on model performance and insights from the dataset.
